The scale-up visa is launched on 22nd August 2022 and it is intended to make it easier for UK businesses experiencing rapid growth to hire the best skilled labour from around the world. Uniquely, the rules allow scale-up visa holders to leave their sponsored role after 6 months and switch to an unsponsored role.
